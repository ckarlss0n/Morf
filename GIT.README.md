#Information regarding Git
It might appear as if one commit has been made in week 25 (after deadline). That however is due to one project member using a computer with a faulty system time configuration at one point during the project. It seems as if at least gitinspector interprets system time instead of server time, which makes this commit appear in the future as of now.

It also seems as if gitinspector does not know the name of one author when looking at the surviving rows. Gitinspector says "unknown" as the name of one author, but it is obvious that those rows are belonging to the author "leigh" (Lage Bergman).
